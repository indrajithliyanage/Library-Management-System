This is a simple project to demonstrate **Git Version Controlling** as well as **Project Managment** through developing a simple web application. This project was created for the SPM (Software Process Management) Module in Year 3 Semester 2.

I have implemented several main features of a Library Management System. And all are done accroding to **Software Project Management Techniques** I have learned from the module. 

I have created all the required **User Stories, Agile Boards** and followed a hypothetical software development scenario to create this.
